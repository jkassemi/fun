# Project TODOs

## Current Issues
- [ ] Fix TextArea widget mounting in test mode
- [ ] Add proper test assertions
- [ ] Implement basic MLX integration

## Next Steps
- [ ] Create minimal transformer for local testing
- [ ] Add geometric transformation layer
- [ ] Implement importance tracking
- [ ] Add visualization of token relationships

## Ideas to Explore
- [ ] Playlist-based geometric lenses
- [ ] Emotion-based transformations
- [ ] Conversation geometry manipulation
- [ ] Dynamic importance propagation

## Development Process
1. Start with small models locally
2. Validate mathematical properties
3. Scale up on remote system
4. Document findings

## Notes
- Using MLX on M3 Mac
- Focus on geometric transformations during inference
- Keep base models intact, transform at runtime
