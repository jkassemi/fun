James Kassemi's personal exploration of a crazy idea.

The novel concept explored here is self-guided reflection (SGR).

I have a particular perspective on reality I'm exploring with this. Combined
with a capable reasoning model, I don't think there's much limit to this. 

Please reach out if you're exploring. I'd like to push this
further forward. (james@kassemi.org)
