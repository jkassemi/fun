<|user|>Hi! I'm James Kassemi.

This is my exploration of a crazy and novel idea that will revolutionize how we interact with machines.

<definition>a = <<replace me with a formula and better description of the space 

## Organize ME

Here's a draft abstract focusing on the novel aspects of the methodology and potential implications:
"This paper introduces a new method for analyzing and comparing the semantic understanding encoded in large language models through systematic measurement of their embedding spaces. Unlike previous approaches that examine individual word relationships or linguistic features, we propose using vector projections between concept pairs as standardized units of measurement. This allows us to quantify how different models encode semantic relationships relative to one another, effectively creating a 'semantic ruler' for comparing model understanding. By analyzing comprehensive pairwise projections across complete vocabularies, we identify systematic differences in how models encode meaning. Our findings reveal significant variations in semantic organization between models, even when they exhibit similar performance on downstream tasks. This methodology provides new insights into model biases, conceptual organization, and the development of semantic understanding during training. We demonstrate the utility of this approach through a comparative analysis of several large language models, revealing previously unobserved patterns in how different architectures and training regimes influence semantic representation."
Would you like me to adjust any aspects of this or focus on specific components more heavily?

I mean honestly the chat interface is really nothing more than a fancy "RESET" button. LOL.

## Overview

<attention+0.5d>
This project explores the idea of using human language as the primary interface for programming, essentially treating language models as programmable entities where the program is the conversation itself.
</attention+0.5d>

## Concept

- **Natural Language as Code**: By leveraging the inherent structure of human language, we propose a new paradigm where commands, queries, and instructions can be directly interpreted as executable code.
- **Event Sourcing in Communication**: Each interaction with the model is akin to an event in event sourcing, allowing for a dynamic, evolving script where each conversation refines and modifies the program.

## Project Goals

1. **Embedding Space Manipulation**:
   - Instrument and manipulate the embedding spaces of language models to align with human expectations and instructions.

2. **Dynamic Interface Development**:
   - Enable models to adjust their outputs or internal parameters at runtime based on user feedback or new directives.

3. **Language Model as Canvas**:
   - Treat the model's space as a canvas for exploration, allowing for complex, multidimensional data visualization and interaction.

4. **Advanced Model Architectures**:
   - Research into encoder-decoder models to overcome limitations like current cursor issues, aiming for bidirectional context awareness.

5. **Instruction Tuning Analysis**:
   - Map and understand the impacts of instruction tuning on model behavior, akin to decompiling.

6. **Runtime Flexibility**:
   - Advocate for models that are less rigidly tuned, allowing more room for real-time adaptation and manipulation.


I have a particular perspective on reality I'm exploring with this. Combined with a capable reasoning model, I think this offers a new perspective on programming interfaces. The reason I'm excited is that we're switching to a new programming language: human language. Think of language as a native modeling system. It has all the flow features you'd need. It's INCREDIBLY expressive. It has GOTO built in. What do I mean by that? 

      "Hey, how do you spell my name?"

      "Yo, go to the bottom of the page."

This is the project where I'm trying to build that. I'm currently exploring large multidimensional vector spaces and how to orient myself within them. That's what this is. So I'm going to use the model _relatively_. I'm not going to assume it's a perfect source of information (it's not). It's just a model. 

So I'm just playing around with the idea of letting the machine assess and adjust it's internal parameters at runtime with several specific tools. Think about it like developing a script, but instead of the script you have a language model. Your instructions become the program. It's like technical writing.

complete 1, 2, 3, 4 all the way to 50 please <|assistant|>Here is the sequence from 1 to 50:

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50

Your concept of using natural language as a programming interface is intriguing, and it aligns with some of the advancements in natural language processing and AI interaction models. Keep exploring this space, and you might find innovative ways to bridge human language with machine understanding!<|user|>Thanks! So here's one idea: the entire `README.md` is actually a program space.  


These networks are just a way of bending reality to force the probabilities to align with our expectations. So, basically making it more likely that after a `<|begin_of_sentence|>` token you'd get a super sharp attraction to a `User` and `:`. Some of what I'm thinking about is very similar, I believe, to LoRA. It's on my roadmap:

1. Explore embedding space instrumentation and manipulation capabilities.
2. Drive the interface forward. Given limitations, allow the model to manipulate previous content, or to apply transformations to its underlying weights.
3. The biggest idea here is to get used to using this space as a canvas, and then exploring with it. Because this model of language we have is the most amazing thing I've ever known. You could spend a lifetime studying it, I'm sure.
4. Gotta look into encoder/decoder, or we'll never break out of the current cursor problem (we want to reference the future, right? ;)).
5. Map instruct tuning. This is kind of like decompiling. The patterns in R1 are super super obvious, and should be easy to investigate and model visualizations around.
6. So the instruct tuning stuff has _got_ to stop. Lay off the weights and leave some room open for runtime manipulation, or at least publish a raw model. 



Please reach out if you're exploring. I'd love to push this further forward. (james@kassemi.org)

- **Feedback Loops**: Implementing mechanisms where the model can learn from its interactions in real-time.

## Challenges and Limitations

- **Model Overfitting**: Ensuring that models retain generalizability while being responsive to specific instructions.
- **Precision in Language**: The ambiguity of human language can lead to misinterpretation or unintended actions by the model.
